# Intro
With this work we want to investigate the relationship between brain metabolism and recptor maps with brain network as described by the resting state functional MRI data.

Data:
The data can be visualized by clicking on the following link : https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6qrfpmqd8ch5cmz/AACbOTmYAhWrJ6z4Z8aC-KNca?dl=0
where PET receptor/metabolic maps and patient functional MRI data are in the same space: MNI152nlin sym 2009c space .
In the dataset we can find a T1w of the template e.g. structural gray matter , white matter and CSF (MNI_T1w).
Moreover we have an Atlas with the segmentation of 100 parcels distributed in 7 different resting state networks-RSNs contained in the MNI_Schaefer_segmentation folder.
